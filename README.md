# TransfusionReaction
Ontology describing blood transfusion reactions.

This ontology was created with the aim of describe eventual problems after a blood transfusion. Basically, knowing some symptoms about a patient, we want to know what caused this problem and the adversed reaction(s), i.e. diagnosis, that a patient may have.
Our target audience is primarily the healthy community.

In this project there was no incorporation of other ontologies.
